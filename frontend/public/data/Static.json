As the system is in equilibrium it fulfills $$\\\\ \\sum \\vec{F}_i=\\vec{0} \\qquad \\sum \\vec{\\tau}_i=\\vec{0}\\\\$$ After applying these conditions we have $$\\\\  \\Big\\{ \\begin{smallmatrix}T_1+T_2-N-Mg & = & 0\\\\mgx+Mg\\frac{x+y}{2}-T_2(x+y) & = & 0\\end{smallmatrix} \\\\$$ Notice that $$N=mg$$ and the torques are evaluated with respect to point O.
