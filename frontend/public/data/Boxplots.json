Furthermore, the histogram is skewed to the left with a tail from 0 to 30.","LinkQ":"data/img/probability/boxplots/Boxplots_01.png"},

        {"id":4,"Q":"Below is a boxplot of yearly tuition and fees of all four year colleges and universities in a Western state. The low outlier is from a private university that gives full scholarships to all accepted students, while the high outlier is from a private college catering to the very rich. Removing both outliers will effect what changes, if any, on the mean and median costs for this stateâ€™s four year institutions of higher learning?","A":[{"id_":1,"opt":"The median will be unchanged, but the mean will decrease.","isAnswer":true},{"id_":2,"opt":"Both the mean and the median will be unchanged.","isAnswer":false},{"id_":3,"opt":"The median will be unchanged, but the mean will increase.","isAnswer":false},{"id_":4,"opt":"The mean will be unchanged, but the median will increase.","isAnswer":false},{"id_":5,"opt":"Both the mean and median will change.","isAnswer":false}],"Points":5,"E":"The high outlier is further from the mean than is the low outlier, so removing both will decrease the mean. However, removing the lowest and highest values will not change what value is in the middle, so the median will be unchanged.","LinkQ":"data/img/probability/boxplots/Boxplots_04.png"},
        {"id":5,"Q":"Below is a boxplot of $$CO_2$$ levels (in grams per kilometer) for a sampling of 2008 vehicles. Suppose follow-up testing determines that the low outlier should be 10 grams per kilometer less and the two high outliers should each be 5  grams per kilometer greater. What effect, if any, will these changes have on the mean and median $$CO_2$$ levels?","A":[{"id_":1,"opt":"The median will be unchanged, but the mean will decrease.","isAnswer":false},{"id_":2,"opt":"Both the mean and the median will be unchanged.","isAnswer":true},{"id_":3,"opt":"The median will be unchanged, but the mean will increase.","isAnswer":false},{"id_":4,"opt":"The mean will be unchanged, but the median will increase.","isAnswer":false},{"id_":5,"opt":"Both the mean and median will change.","isAnswer":false}],"Points":5,"E":"Subtracting 10 from one value and adding 5 to two values leaves the sum of the values unchanged, so the mean will be unchanged. Exactly what values the outliers take will not change what value is in the middle, so the median will be unchanged.","LinkQ":"data/img/probability/boxplots/Boxplots_05.png"}
